# Bookshelf Web App
Made by: Vito Hartanto

The app is suitable for book enthusiasts. Its purpose is to enable users to track books they haven't read or have already read. It features local storage capable of holding up to 10 MB of data, ensuring information is stored on individual devices and won't be lost when the web app or device is turned off. Data can be deleted by pressing the delete button. There is a search feature based on book titles to facilitate searching.

Hopefully, this app proves useful for you. Thank you.
